      <p>Fragments of landscapes—projections of rippling water, reflections on
        glass—are magnified for our consideration in Ridges on the Horizontal Plane.
        Fowler and Tsunoda share a curiosity about the mechanics of perception and
        the ways in which worldly phenomena are typically received and understood.
        In their collaborations, they distill the interrelated and frequently invisible
        elements that allow even the simplest action to occur. Here, for instance,
        winds produced by fans make a fabric screen billow. This wind produces
        distortion in the image, and occasionally the gusts are forceful enough to
        cause the screen to brush up against the strings of a piano. The strings are
        pulled taut across the screen, and upon contact they emit an audible drone.
        Quite literally, the artists have made sound and image collide, and in doing
        so they have opened up ways of listening and looking that highlight the
        interdependence and interconnection of the occurrences of everyday life.</p>

      <p>Travelling to remote corners of the earth to make her field recordings,
        Winderen uses hydrophones (sensitive underwater microphones) to collect
        sounds inaudible or inaccessible to unassisted human ears. She makes her
        compositions and installations from the material of her recordings. “The pieces,”
        she has written, “develop by listening again and again and slowly, slowly collaging
        things together, more like sculpting than writing.” <br><br>
        To create Ultrafield, Winderen
        worked with sounds in the ultrasound range, which is above the hearing capacity of
        humans but in which many mammal and insect species communicate. The artist recorded
        the sounds made by certain species of bats, fish, and underwater insects and pitched
        these transmissions down to the human range, allowing us to experience sonic realities
        that are otherwise out of reach.</p>

    2012. Ink on archival facsimile of score; framed. Part one of five parts. Courtesy <br>the
    artist and Anna Schwartz Gallery.</h5>
      <p>To make these drawings Fusinato chose a point on the page and then ruled a line
        from every note in the composition back to that point. This ongoing series, initiated
         in 2007, is founded—literally overlaid—on the scores of pioneering avant-garde composers.
          In the works on view here, Fusinato has drawn on a score penned by the Greek composer
          Iannis Xenakis (1922–2001), whose groundbreaking post–World War II works were deeply
          informed by mathematical and architectural logic, and, later, by computer programming.
          Xenakis worked for more than a decade in the studio of the architect Le Corbusier, and
          he often composed with an existing architectural site in mind. Here Fusinato has used
          Xenakis's score in the same way—as a pre-existing space.<br><br>
This drawing and others in the artist's Mass Black Implosion series
have an immense gravitational density, which seems to suggest that all
the notes should be played at once. Fusinato's intervention thus shifts
the scores away from Xenakis's original intention, collapsing linear/durational
performance into simultaneity.</p>

  <h5><span class="title">Triplight.</span><br>
    2008. Microphone cage, stand, light, electronics, dimensions variable. Courtesy the artist</h5>
      <p>To make Triplight, Norment started with a 1955 Shure microphone—the model used by Billie Holliday,
        Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, and other legendary jazz singers. Norment removed its original
         parts and replaced them with a small flickering light. This light casts a shadow, projecting
         onto the wall what appears to be a luminescent rib cage, evocative of an absent performer.<br><br>

The title refers to the expression “trip the light fantastic,” which means to dance lightly and nimbly,
 not unlike the way the light in Norment’s piece bounces off the wall. The phrase was popularized in
 1894 in the chorus of the slow waltz song “Sidewalks of New York”: “Boys and girls together, me and
 Mamie O'Rourke/Tripped the light fantastic/On the sidewalks of New York.” Thus, the piece also
 functions as a romantic elegy for a New York City of the past, where people waltzed on sidewalks.</p>

      <p>In her series Scores and Transcripts, Sun Kim—who was born deaf—combines and transforms
        the various types of notation that shape her understanding and communication: among them,
        American Sign Language, musical notation, English vernacular, and body language. To her,
        each of these has its own parameters, social value, and set of rules. In the drawings,
        these grammars and languages rub up against each other, allowing for the examination of
        their similarities and differences and shifting her personal relationship to them.<br><br>

In All. Day. the artist has traced the path her hand would take to communicate the concept
“all day” in American Sign Language—an arc that mirrors the movement of the sun. The central
annotation is a rest bar (the musical symbol for a silent interval), and adjacent to this she
has written the number 126,144,000, which is an approximate calculation of how many rest bars
would add up to the thirty-two years of silence she had experienced at the time she made this drawing.</p>

  <h5><span class="title">AION.</span><br>
     2006. Photograph, Lambda print on dibond. Courtesy the artist</h5>
      <p>Kirkegaard’s AION—“infinity” or “eternity” in ancient Greek—was
        inspired by the groundbreaking sound work I am sitting in a room
        (1969), by artist Alvin Lucier (American, born 1931), in which
        Lucier recorded himself saying, “I am sitting in a room, different
        from the one you are in now. I am recording the sound of my
        speaking voice.” He then played these phrases back and re-recorded
        them. He did this repeatedly until his words were unrecognizable,
        his voice smoothed into a warbly hum. Kirkegaard has taken Lucier’s
        action a step further, placing recording equipment in four abandoned
        spaces inside the exclusion area near the Chernobyl nuclear power
        plant site (a swimming pool, a concert hall, a gymnasium, and a church),
        then re-recording the results. In the final recordings, each of these
        ostensibly silent, empty spaces takes on a very distinct resonance.
        In effect, Kirkegaard has recorded the voices of rooms.</p>

  <h5><span class="title">Frame for a Painting.</span><br>
     2012. LEDs, bicycle light, LED drivers, active speakers, and table, 10:54 min. Courtesy the artist</h5>
      <p>In Mirza’s installations, each element is reliant on and responsive to others and to the architecture
        of the site. Mirza refers to these as “self-governing” systems. Often these works appear familiar and
        slightly outdated, evocative of a 1990s rave, an early video game, or a living room. All of this is
        true in Frame for a Painting. Each iteration of the work includes a different painting, chosen from
        the collection of the venue where it is installed. Here, from MoMA’s collection, the artist has chosen
        Composition in Yellow, Blue, and White, I (1937), by Piet Mondrian. Mirza’s “framing” devices are many.
         Not only is the painting framed physically by LED lights synced to an electronic sound track, but
         conceptually it is recontextualized as an element in an installation dated 2012. Furthermore, it’s
          juxtaposed against a midcentury Danish side table and is installed in an exhibition pointedly
          addressing sound as such. Nonetheless, Mirza’s installation honors themes already evident in Mondrian’s
           painting—including the particularities of color, material, and rhythm—and ultimately underscores
           the pleasures and idiosyncrasies of sensory interplay.</p>
